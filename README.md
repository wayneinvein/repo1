The "Guess the Word Game" is a simple word-guessing game where players choose a category like fruits, animals, or countries and attempt to guess a randomly selected word from that category. The word's letters are hidden as underscores, and players reveal letters by guessing them one at a time. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lifelines, with the player losing if they run out of lifelines before guessing the entire word. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses all letters (winning) or exhausts all lifelines (losing). The interface includes buttons for each letter, and players can start a new game at any time.
The game is structured using HTML, providing a semantic layout with sections for selecting categories, displaying the word to guess, the alphabet for guessing, lifeline count, and game status.
The game is visually styled using CSS to create an engaging and responsive user interface. This includes a dark-themed background, styled buttons, and dynamic feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
The game logic is handled with JavaScript, managing word selection, user input handling, and game state (win/loss conditions). The JavaScript code dynamically updates the UI based on user interactions and ensures the game flows smoothly.
